Randomize cards with shuffling
There are 2-4 players for a normal 52 card deck
The highest value is an ace and the lowest is 2; 
A two cannot beat an ace
Each player is dealt three blind cards facedown, which they do not look at
Each player is then dealt six other cards, which they are allowed to look at
Of these six,each player selects three exit cards to place on top of their blind cards
The players will use these cards after the remainder of the deck has been used up
Players typically choose their best cards to serve as exit cards
The remainder of the deck is placed face down in the middle of the players
The first card on top of the remainder of the deck is flipped over and serves as the base card
At this point, game play has began and the players' exit cards are final and cannot be swapped out
Players must play cards of larger value than the base card, disregarding suites
As players play cards, they must replace them with the card on top of the remainder of the deck
Only one card may be played at a time 
Special cards may be played: 10 is a bomb, 7 means only cards with values from 2-7 can be played, and 3 is a mirror card
When a bomb is played, all the cards on the table are cleared, including the bomb, not returning them to the deck
When a mirror is played, it takes on the properties of the card directly beneath it
If a player cannot beat the card on the table when it is their turn:
The next person attempts to beat the card
If no one can beat the card:
The person who originally played the card may now go, and play anything in their hand
If the deck in the middle has been exhuasted:
Players must finish playing their final hand of cards
If a player had finished their final hand:
The player must now take their previously selected exit cards and play those by the normal rules
If a player plays all of their exit cards:
The player should select their blind cards one at a time when it is their turn to play
If their blind card does not beat the card they were trying to beat:
They must pick up all cards previously played and play those before returning to their blind cards
Players who believe their blind cards will not beat the played card may pass when it is their turn as many times as they wish
The first player to play all their cards, including blind cards, wins
